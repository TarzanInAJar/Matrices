   Description:
   This Ant build script provides a set of extra build tools. These tools
   provide things such as source-code and byte-code analysis, metrics, and
   coverage reports.

   To use the build script from NetBeans, you have to set the tools.dir to the
   location that contains the binaries for the set of build tools that the
   script makes use of. The place to do this is by modifying the
   nbproject/private/private.properties file. This ensures you can use a path
   that is local to your specific system but that it will not propagate that
   system-specific path to other projects.
